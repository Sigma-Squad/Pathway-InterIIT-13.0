ads-b. this system is a critical part of aviation safety infrastructure. several services, such as flightaware, flightradar24, and ads-b exchange, collect this information with ground-based radio receivers and publish it on the internet. flightaware and flightradar24 will hide aircraft on request from the owner, but ads-b exchange does not, and provides unfiltered data. elon musk has threatened to take legal action against people who share tracking data from his jet online, referring to it as \"doxxing\" and claiming it's a threat to his safety. he also bans twitter users who post any plane-tracking information. i don't see how he could have any claim for legal action against people who track his jet. as i have mentioned, ads-b data is by no means private. when you are on an airplane, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for your location. collecting public information about a controversial public figure seems like a very clear case for first amendment protection. this wouldn't affect his ability to ban twitter users; he can (within reason) ban anyone for anything on twitter because he owns it.

(it's quite odd that he claims to be a free-speech absolutist but censors the reposting of public information, but that's beside the point.) it would, however, seem to preclude any involvement of the government. what possible legal action could elon musk take against people who post ads-b data from his private jet? specifically, the threatened action is about stalking and implicit threats to his family. i'm not suggesting that there is a lot of merit to the claim, but that is how he is presenting the argument. the question would be where there is an intentional, repeated following of a person for the purpose of harassing the person with express or implied threats of violence or death. the jury would have to decide whether the implicit threat is credible (somebody plans to blow him or his family out of the sky), a decision would probably turn on the number of death threats he receives. to expand on @user6726's answer, and get into the legal specificities, since the only duty not to do this, really, arises generally out of those predominantly criminal statutes, a \"legal action\" would resort to a tort action which is \"in essence is the breach of a nonconsensual duty owed another. violation of a statutory duty to another may therefore be a tort and violation of a statute embodying a public policy is generally actionable even though no specific civil remedy is provided in the statute itself. any injured member of the public for whose benefit the statute was enacted may bring the action.

would be required to prove his case merely by the preponderance of the evidence, or the same threshold would be required as if the civil defendant would be under criminal prosecution which could be a question of its own here. although true that his flight information is public, it can reasonably be argued that a certain level of expertise knowledge is required for a layman to be able to use the raw, publicly available information to make a threat on his life which would certainly help filter out some wackos even if equally certainly could not prevent any more sophisticated or orginazied attempts on his life. to decide which one is of greater concern would definitely be a question to be decided by the trier of fact. just as\nContent: stack exchange network consists of 183 q&a

street and recorded for a whole year, i could capture at least 1 million unique faces and 100k unique license plates over a single year. this data could potentially be highly valuable to law enforcement agencies, private investigators, shopping analytics firms, insurance companies and many others. these hypothetical cameras would only capture public areas where people don't have an expectation of privacy. the footage would be stored for several years and analyzed using face/car recognition tools, creating a massive database of license plates and faces. this would be a private, commercial enterprise not sponsored by the government. question: would this be legal in new york city? therefore as per my understanding this would be completely legal? although you're located in ny

citizens, and gdpr \"applies\" to anyone doing that, regardless of your location and the location of the eu citizen [edit: thanks to chao, i now believe i was mistaken on that.] if you are careful to gather data only in the us, from people located in the us at the time, and you're also careful not to combine it with data that is subject to gdpr, then i think you can keep clean. so, photos of your street clearly are in the us. if the \"face recognition\" step that you propose adds to the value of your database with publicly-visible data from the eu (such as getting someone's name via matches to their social media pics), then you could be processing data from the eu. \"extra-territorial\" claims can be difficult, but at the point you're selling the data hopefully you can afford a lawyer to check this properly. so, you asked \"is this legal in new york city\", and i think by that you probably meant \"does this break any ny or federal law\"? to which the answer does seem to be \"no\". however, if you are not careful you might be creating criminal liability in other jurisdictions to which you may wish to travel in future. in that limited sense it's \"not legal\" to do the thing

thing while located in ny, even though it's \"legal in ny\"! i said gdpr \"applies\", because of course committing an offence with respect to a foreign jurisdiction is arguably no problem, provided you never subject yourself to that jurisdiction. to take another example, if you were shipping illegal drugs into the eu then you might expect the eu to arrest you if they ever had the opportunity, regardless of the fact that you personally had never been there, and so every action of which you're accused took place in new york. the difference there, of course, is that your drug dealing probably would also be an offence in new york, so us law enforcement and courts would take an interest. but the principle stands that it is possible to incur criminal liability in a jurisdiction without ever physically entering that jurisdiction's territory. if you sell this valuable data into the eu, then your business presence there (for example any bank accounts you use to collect revenues) are potentially at risk. so, you'd want to accept payment using some mechanism located outside the eu, and preferably one that is not subject to eu legal rulings (for example visa could ban you and/or attempt to reclaim money, if ordered to do so by an eu court, because visa values its own eu presence). in fact, even if you don't sell this data into the eu, any business presence you have in the eu is potentially at risk if you're fined. ultimately, and this is a long way down a rocky legal road, if you have sufficiently serious rulings against you then you could find yourself unable safely to visit the eu. but even supposing you somehow manage to escalate this operation to the point where you're not just facing a gdpr fine that you'll never pay -- you're an international scofflaw, wanted in multiple countries on multiple serious offences, including the eu, uk, and china, none of which happens to be illegal in ny. then... you would have to take some care when you travel. the us won't extradite you for something that's not a crime in the us, but what's the extradition status between the place you're travelling to, and all of the countries in which you're a wanted criminal? i realise that this in some sense is similar to asking, \"was it illegal in 1940s in the soviet union to plan the killing of a defector in america, such as walter krivitsky?\". the us, given the opportunity, might well have prosecuted that as a crime. but, if he was killed, the soviets wouldn't, and whoever ordered it presumably wasn't planning ever to go to the us (or not without diplomatic protection). so it's fully legal in the same sense your hypothetical gdpr-violations are fully legal. it would be meaningless nit-picking to say that although legal in the soviet union, the plot would incur criminal liability in the usa. the difference is that there's more international co-operation now, and more likelihood you might like to travel internationally for business or pleasure, than was the case for senior officials in the nkvd. this would probably\nContent: stack exchange network consists of 183 q&a communities including stack overflow, the largest, most trusted online community for

if the data is legal to acquire, it becomes illegal to gather and store and share it, because the resulting data set is more or less a kind of privacy invasion or privacy threat? even if you gather from public sources, you need to comply with the gdpr to process personal identifiable data. that means you need a strictly legal basis to even be allowed to gather them. that you gathered them from all over just means you made data of others identifiable. the threshold at which you have to comply with gdpr is the moment you start to gather data about people in europe. as nvoigt correctly noted, a phonebook is the easiest example in europe: a person is only listed in the phone book because the phone book maker has an interest and usually consent. this consent is not given to anyone other but the phone book company, and this consent is not transferable. to process the data in a phonebook but for purely personal use (e.g. as a company), you are required to have another legal basis to process it. among them is legitimate interest or to get consent from the data subject. data scraping, under the gdpr, is almost impossible and very risky: do you remember equifax? they were struck with the worst of all punishments. not a fine, but they had to destroy any part of their database that contained any data obtained without consent, because some of the data was obtained by illegal scraping. do you remember clearview? fined 20 million by italy for violation of the gdpr, together with an order banning clearvieww from operating in italy and to delete all data from people inside italy in february 2022. they had to delete their french database in 2021. and they were fined another 7.5 million in the uk in november 2022. some countries also have a copyright-akin right in databases, which disallows scraping data from those databases. united-states there is no such law in the united states. it is legal to collect large amounts of raw data from public sources and share it. usually, even information protected by a non-disclosure agreement, or a statutory privacy requirement can be legally collected and shared once it becomes a matter of public record or is made public (although this isn't true for certain national defense information, and for information obtained in confidential attorney-client communications if the attorney is the one seeking to share it). there is no generally applicable right to privacy of information in the united states, although sometimes there a privacy rights associated with information disclosed in the context of certain specific kinds of relationships (e.g. banker-customer, attorney-client, health care provider-patient). some u.s. states protect more privacy in more specific relationships than other u.s. states. some public data sources, such as pacer, the public database of the federal courts, charge users for large downloads of data from their database, but not for small downloads of data, however. indeed, even privately collected assemblies of raw data are not protected by copyright. see feist publications, inc. v. rural tel. serv. co., 499 u.s. 340 (1991). the goal of \"sharing information\" may possibly be illegal itself, depending on what you are sharing and why, regardless of where the information came from. as an example, a student named jack sweeney is currently being threatened with legal action by taylor swift, because he runs social media accounts that compile public faa data to publish tracking of celebrities' jets. all the data sweeney uses is publicly available to anyone, but swift's
